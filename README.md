# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description 

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the [Moment.js project status page](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

## Usage 

Click into a time block, enter an event, click the save button for that time block, and the text for that event is saved in local storage. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

## Languages & Libaries / Frameworks

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* moment.js
